# Introduction

The main idea is to share and explore a little bit about frontend technologies, like [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), to automate task like minification, compilation, unit testing and so on. Also takes a look a little example about Css pre-processors like [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and a cool tool such [browserSync](https://browsersync.io/) that it makes easier to test our changes in a real time way.
BTW I took advantage for show how Angular JS works, so I use concepts like controllers, factories, directives, etc.

## Note
> I'm not an expert on frontend technologies, I just wanna share a code that I explore by myself in order to learn new things and I hope will be useful for you.
**¡¡IMPORTANT: I made this code about one year!!!**

## Prerequisites and Installation Requirements
1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/es/)
2. Get a IDE, like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or whatever you prefer (even a notepad)

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Execute `npm install` command in order to install all dependencies or packages what I used to the lab.(It's important you're on the main path on the console, e.g: `cd mypath\Frontend_Lab`)
3. Execute `grunt` command in order to start the automated tasks configured on _Gruntfile.js_
4. Execute `http-server` in order to serve the application
5. Run on node server created earlier, e.g: http://127.0.0.1:8080/views/shared.html#/
